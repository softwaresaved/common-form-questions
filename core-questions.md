# Common Form Questions
_by Shoaib Sufi_

## Introduction
Through events and the fellowship and other SSI activities, it's clear that consistency in how we ask questions and the data we collect will allow us to do better analysis to understand our activities.

This document covers the common questions we ask (and most of them have reasons and when they are applicable)

We have a number of sections covering

* Core Questions(CQ) - file:core-questions.md - mainly pertaining to demographics
* Participation Questions(EPQ) - file:participation-questions.md -  information gathering that drive the content of events
* Logistics Questions(ELQ) - file:logistics-questions.md - information gathered to help organise logistics of e.g. place, food and access.
