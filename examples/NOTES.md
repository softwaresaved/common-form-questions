# Notes on how the examples are structured

In the example file we show examples of complete questionniares but in the format used by the CFQ.

Some of the element in the format of the CFQ as see here - https://github.com/softwaresaved/common-form-questions/blob/master/docs/format/format.md

Are only useful for describing the actual format e.g. 'Section-Reason' - these elements which are there to inform those putting the quesionnaire together are not included in the examples.

Those elements which someone answering the survey would see are included. Note where the format support alternatives sets of answers we only show one as this is what those answering the questions would see.

See the section on 'Format Items'  - https://github.com/softwaresaved/common-form-questions/blob/master/docs/format/format.md#format-items for further information.
