# Logistics Questions(LQ)

## Introduction
These questions are mainly pertaining to information which will help us run events, what's applicable might be different if the event is run in person or virtually and whether or not we are providing catering etc.

## The Logistics Questions
Questions will appear as sub headings (level 3) of this section unless they are a sub question.

### Will you be attending \<this part of the schedule\>

#### Note:
\<this part of the schedule\> could be something like the Dinner at a workshop, the Hackday evening at CW or the main Hackday, any part which might be considered distinct enough to require planning around but where the intent is not clear when people are registering.

#### Options:
* Yes
* No
* Not sure
 

### Please provide details of any dietary requirements we should be aware of (to help us with planning)

#### Note:
Don't turn this into a dropdown list, the scope of options in too large, better to get people to describe their sitution in their own terms.
