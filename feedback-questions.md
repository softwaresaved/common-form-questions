# Feedback Questions(FBQ)

## Introduction
These questions are mainly pertaining to feedback from running events or competitions, applicability and notes are included in the questions stated. Note - if people took part in different parts of the event of competition the it's worth asking which part the took part in so you can match the feedback to what they took part in - this is more of a logistical question thoughso it's not stated here but something to keep in mind when designing your survey.
